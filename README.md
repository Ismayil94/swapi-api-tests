## How to Setup?

| Step | Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | `npm install` | Installing required `node_modules` |
| 2. | `npm test` | For testing and generating report (PS. first it removes existing report (`rimraf` module)) |

## Reports & Results

Reports are generated by `mochawasome` module.
[go to reports folder](./reports/)

Also, I didn't silenced console outputs (`quiet` mode), so the results will be in console as well.
